### Libraries and Tools Used

The following libraries and tools were used in this Android project:

- [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/): A dependency injection framework for Android that simplifies the process of dependency injection and promotes modularity in your app.

- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/): A type-safe HTTP client for making network requests, used for connecting with web services and APIs.

- [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html): Kotlin's native support for asynchronous and concurrent programming, used to simplify asynchronous code and manage background tasks.
- [Kotlin Flows](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html)

- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide): An image loading library for efficient loading and caching of images.

- [ViewModels](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel): Part of Android's Architecture Components, ViewModels are used for managing UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.

- [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata): Part of Android's Architecture Components, LiveData is used for building data objects that notify views when the underlying data changes.

- [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation): A library for handling navigation and UI-related components.

- [Use Cases](): A software architectural pattern used to separate the application's business logic from the presentation layer, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.

- [MVI]() (Model-View-Intent) Pattern: A modern architectural pattern that enforces a unidirectional flow of data and events in the app, facilitating a more predictable and testable application state.

- Clean Architecture: A software design approach that separates an application into layers with clear responsibilities, promoting modularity, maintainability, and testability.

- [Unit Testing](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/local-tests) (View model ,repository, use cases)

This project follows clean architecture principles to maintain a separation of concerns and promote code maintainability. The MVI pattern ensures a clear and predictable flow of data in the application, while Dagger Hilt simplifies dependency injection for modularity and testability.
